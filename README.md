This repository contains the code and the data artifacts of submission #28 at DIMVA2025.  

If you use this data or code, please cite the authors.  

# Data  

The `data` directory contains the PCAP and the CSV files generated by the authors.
Files beginning with "cs" are malicious traffic-linked files.
This traffic must be labeled as "Cobalt Strike" or "Malicious" in datasets.  

Files beginning with "benign" are benign traffic.
This traffic must be labeled as "Benign" in datasets.   

Because of licence compatibility, we do not provide PCAP or CSV for the UPC, UPNA and CTU datasets.
The features for these datasets can be retrieved by using the [**nfdump**](https://github.com/phaag/nfdump) tool on the associated PCAP files.

# Code

The code used in our machine learning experiments is in the `src` directory.  
A README.md file inside this directory explains what are the different scripts and how to reproduce the results.
